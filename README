This is the Blackjack coding challenge and a chance for you to impress us.
Your mission is to use this project to implement a game of Blackjack using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and submit it to the following e-mail address no
later than February 13th, 2012:

                       utchallenge@evernote.com

Feel free to bend the Blackjack rules, simplify, or make up your own, and find
cool and creative ways to do things like shuffling cards and displaying the
cards on screen - it's up to you.  Make sure that if you do something
different, you provide instructions on how your game is played.

The project for this coding challenge is located at the following URL:

https://github.com/Evernote-Austin/BlackjackChallenge

You will find the code to get you started in the html/ directory.  The project
was created as a Qt Creator HTML 5 app in case you wish to add any native hooks
to your game.  However, it is perfectly acceptable if you decide to only play
with the code in the html/ directory.
